    There are some problems with fetching guestbook posts as they are
    retrieved by javascript after the page is loaded. They are fetched
    trough a SOAP server.
    
    Made some tests with curl for trying to retrieve data from the SOAP
    server, but was sadly unable to get any results.
    
    Currently avaiting reply from Dag. He's out of office until
    next week.

  - We have to put this issue on hold. Should be fixed in a later release.
